# InstagramFilter

Instagram has a large collection of filters. In this assignment I will try to create my own, copying features from a few of them in order to achieve the a sepia, invert and grayscale colour effect.

The canvas on the **left** shows the original picture without any filter being applied.\
The canvas on the **right** shows the picture whereby a filter has been applied.

When the program starts up, it will show a sepia filter with rounded borders:

Pressing the Up arrow button will apply the invert colour filter:

Pressing the Down arrow button will apply the grayscale colour filter:
